CLApp is a command line app to make other command line apps. It is basically a configurable command line app generator.

# CL-inception!

## Features

- Configurable (args, set defaults)
- Auto updates

## How to install

- Clone the repo
- Run the install file in the repo
- Run `clapp -v` to see the version, and `clapp -h` to see the help

If you don't see anything or an error then the install failed for some reason. Try running again and possibly as admin

## How to use

CLApp is quite simple to use, and CLApp actually sets a lot of defaults for you, so you don't have to worry about it. The simplest form of the command is to run:

`clapp -n <name>`

This will use the default app type (bash unless you changed it in settings or specified a type) and the default location (current working directory, same contigency as type).

More advanced direction can be found in the help

## How to update

CLApp is automatically updated, so you don't have to worry about it.
